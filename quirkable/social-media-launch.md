### Launch Announcement Post

**Post Text:**
```
I'm excited to announce the launch of Quirkable – a 3D printing service designed to help UK businesses, designers, and innovators bring their ideas to life faster.

After years in product design and rapid prototyping, I've seen firsthand how challenging it can be to get quality 3D prints, especially when files have issues or you need custom design work.

That's why we built Quirkable differently:

🔧 We specialize in file repair – fixing models that other services reject
💡 We offer full design services – from sketch to print-ready CAD
🎯 We focus on quality and communication – you'll always know what's happening with your project
⚡ We move fast – prototypes in days, not weeks

Our services:
• Rapid prototyping for product development
• Custom part design and manufacturing
• File optimization and repair
• Small-batch production
• Design consultancy

Whether you're developing a new product, need replacement parts, or want to test concepts quickly, we're here to help.

For businesses: We offer volume discounts, NDAs for confidential projects, and dedicated support for ongoing partnerships.

### LinkedIn Article: "Why We Started Quirkable"

**Title:** Why We Started a 3D Printing Service in 2024 (And Why Now Is the Perfect Time)

**Excerpt:**
```
After spending years in product design, I kept seeing the same problem: brilliant ideas stuck in the digital realm because 3D printing services were either too expensive, too slow, or couldn't handle complex files.

### B2B Focused Posts

**Case Study Post:**
```
CLIENT SUCCESS STORY 🚀

A London-based startup came to us with a product prototype that needed 8 design iterations before their pitch to investors.

The Challenge:
• Tight 3-week deadline
• Multiple design changes expected
• Budget constraints
• Needed professional presentation quality

Our Approach:
• Fixed-price prototype package
• 48hr turnaround per iteration
• Material consultancy included
• Render package for pitch deck

The Result:
They secured seed funding and are now our ongoing manufacturing partner for small-batch production.

Turnaround: 3 weeks, 8 iterations
Investment: £650 for prototyping
Their outcome: £150K seed round
