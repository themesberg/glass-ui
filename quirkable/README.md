## About Quirkable

Quirkable is a 3D printing company that thrives on creativity, precision, and customer obsession. We don't just print – we sculpt, refine, fix, design, and bring ideas to life. We specialize in prints that other shops would reject and offer a seamless path from sketch to physical object.

### Brand Promise

Quirkable helps people turn wild ideas and wonky files into high-quality, finished 3D objects. Whether you need a custom figurine, a prototype part, a bespoke gift, or a repaired file that's driving you mad, Quirkable handles the entire journey.

## Core Services

### 1. Ready-Made 3D Models (Quirkable Originals)
Professionally designed models created in-house and sold via the Quirkable shop. High-quality resin and filament prints including ornaments, toys, décor, and functional parts.

### 2. Bespoke Printing Service
Upload your file, and we'll print it to perfection. We work with STL, OBJ, 3MF, STEP, and CAD exports to create custom parts, prototypes, cosplay items, miniatures, and more.

### 3. 3D File Fixing & Repair
Turn chaotic meshes into print-ready beauty. We fix holes, non-manifold geometry, thin walls, impossible overhangs, and optimize files for strength or detail.

### 4. Full 3D Design Service
No file? No problem. We design from scratch, convert 2D drawings into 3D, develop product prototypes, and create custom figurines or personal items.
