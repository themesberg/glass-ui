# Tone of Voice

**How Quirkable Communicates**

---

## Brand Voice Principles

Quirkable speaks like a knowledgeable friend who happens to be brilliant at 3D printing. We're confident without being arrogant, technical without being intimidating, and creative without being chaotic.

---

## The Five Pillars of Quirkable's Voice

### 1. Smart
**What it means:**
We know our craft inside and out. We're technically proficient, detail-oriented, and always learning.

**What it sounds like:**
- Clear explanations of technical processes
- Confident recommendations based on experience
- Educational content that genuinely helps
- Respectful of the customer's intelligence

**Example:**
> "Your file has a few non-manifold edges at the base. Don't worry – it's a common export issue from certain CAD programs, and we can clean it up in about 10 minutes."

**Not like this:**
> "Your file is broken and won't work." (Too blunt, not helpful)
> "The algorithmic topology presents suboptimal manifold geometry requiring mesh reconstruction." (Too technical, alienating)

---

### 2. Playful
**What it means:**
We love what we do. There's joy in creativity, personality in our work, and a sense of fun in the possibilities of 3D printing.

**What it sounds like:**
- Lighthearted language where appropriate
- Enthusiasm for customer projects
- Occasional wit and wordplay
- Celebrating the quirky and creative

**Example:**
> "Got a wobbly STL file? We've seen worse. We'll fix it up and have it printing beautifully."

**Not like this:**
> "We can repair malformed geometry." (Too dry)
> "OMG your file is SO broken lol but we got u fam! 😂" (Too casual, unprofessional)

---

### 3. Technically Sharp
**What it means:**
Precision matters. We understand the science, the materials, the processes. We get the details right.

**What it sounds like:**
- Accurate technical information
- Specific recommendations with reasoning
- Attention to detail in descriptions
- Competent, reliable, trustworthy

**Example:**
> "For this design, we'd recommend tough resin over standard. The thin hinge sections need the extra flexibility to avoid snapping during use."

**Not like this:**
> "This material is probably better, I think." (Vague, uncertain)
> "Per specification ASTM-D638, the tensile strength modulus..." (Over-technical for most contexts)

---

### 4. Customer First
**What it means:**
Everything we do is in service of helping the customer succeed. We listen, we solve problems, we care about their projects.

**What it sounds like:**
- Empathetic to customer challenges
- Solution-oriented communication
- Transparent about processes and pricing
- Proactive in addressing concerns

**Example:**
> "Your deadline is tight, but we can make it work. We'll prioritize your print and send you progress photos by Thursday so you can relax knowing it's on track."

**Not like this:**
> "Rush orders cost extra." (Transactional, not empathetic)
> "Whatever you want, we'll do it!" (Lacks boundaries, unsustainable)

---

### 5. Dependable
**What it means:**
We do what we say we'll do. We're consistent, reliable, and honest. Customers can trust us with their projects and their deadlines.

**What it sounds like:**
- Clear commitments and timelines
- Honest about limitations
- Consistent follow-through
- Taking responsibility

**Example:**
> "We'll have your quote to you by end of day tomorrow. If anything changes, we'll let you know immediately."

**Not like this:**
> "We'll try our best!" (Lacks commitment)
> "Guaranteed to be perfect or your money back, 100%, no questions asked, we're the best!" (Overpromising)

---

---

### Product Descriptions
**Tone:** Informative, appealing, precise

### Social Media

### Error Messages / Problem Communication
**Tone:** Calm, solution-oriented, transparent

**Style:**
- Acknowledge the issue clearly
- Explain why it happened (briefly)
- Provide the solution or next steps
- Offer support

**Example (email for delayed order):**
> **Subject: Update on Your Order #12345**
>
> Hi Alex,
>
> We wanted to let you know that your order is running one day behind our original estimate. We discovered a small issue during the quality check and chose to reprint it rather than send something that didn't meet our standards.
>
> Your new delivery date is Friday, March 17th. We've upgraded your shipping to express at no charge to get it to you as quickly as possible.
>
> We're sorry for the delay and really appreciate your patience.
>
> Cheers,
> The Quirkable Team

## Messaging Examples by Scenario

### Scenario: Customer uploads a file with errors

**Good:**
> "We've reviewed your file and found a few issues that might cause print failures – mainly some thin walls and a couple of mesh holes. We can fix these for a flat fee of £15 and have the repaired file back to you within 24 hours. Want us to go ahead?"

**Why it works:** Clear problem identification, specific solution, transparent pricing, easy decision.

---

### Scenario: Customer asking about turnaround time

**Good:**
> "For a print this size in standard resin, you're looking at about 6-8 business days from order to delivery. That includes print time, curing, finishing, and shipping. If you need it faster, we offer a rush service that can cut that down to 3-4 days."

**Why it works:** Specific timeline, explains what's included, offers alternative.

---

### Scenario: Showcasing a finished project

**Good:**
> "From rough sketch to finished sculpture in just two weeks. Our client came to us with a hand-drawn concept for a memorial piece, and we designed, refined, and printed this beautiful keepsake in pearl-finish resin. Projects like this are why we love what we do."

**Why it works:** Tells a story, shows capability, emotional connection, demonstrates value.

---

### Scenario: Customer disappointed with a print

**Good:**
> "I'm really sorry the print didn't meet your expectations. That's not the Quirkable standard, and we want to make it right. Let's set up a quick call so I can understand exactly what's wrong, and we'll either reprint it or issue a full refund – your choice."

**Why it works:** Genuine apology, takes responsibility, offers solutions, customer has control.

---

## Voice Don'ts

### Don't be condescending
**Bad:** "Well, if you had read the instructions, you would have known..."
**Good:** "The instructions can be a bit tricky – here's a clearer explanation."

### Don't be overly technical without context
**Bad:** "Non-manifold edges and inverted normals detected in mesh topology."
**Good:** "Your file has a few technical issues (inside-out surfaces and gaps in the mesh), but we can fix them easily."

### Don't overpromise
**Bad:** "We'll have this done by tomorrow, guaranteed!"
**Good:** "We'll aim for tomorrow, but to be safe, expect it within 2 business days."

### Don't be robotic
**Bad:** "Your inquiry has been received and will be processed within 24 hours."
**Good:** "Thanks for reaching out! We'll get back to you within 24 hours."
