## Section 1: Design Service Overview

### Headline
**Your Idea. Our Expertise. Physical Reality.**

### Description
Most people have brilliant ideas for things they'd love to create. A custom gift, a product prototype, a replacement part for something vintage, a character brought to life.

**The problem? Turning ideas into 3D models requires specialist software, years of experience, and technical knowledge most people don't have.**

That's exactly where Quirkable's design service comes in.

Tell us what you want. Show us sketches, photos, measurements, or just describe your vision. Our team of experienced 3D designers will model it professionally, iterate based on your feedback, and deliver a print-ready file you fully own.

**Then we can print it for you—or you can take the file anywhere you like.**

No 3D modeling skills needed. No expensive software. No months learning CAD. Just your idea and our expertise.

**Common Questions About Our Design Service**

**Q: I only have a rough sketch. Is that enough to start?**

A: Absolutely! Rough sketches are perfect starting points. We'll work with you to refine the concept and clarify details through the design process.

---

**Q: Can you design from just a description, no images?**

A: Yes, though having visual references helps tremendously. We'll discuss your vision in detail and provide concept sketches before committing to full 3D modeling.

---

**Q: How many revisions do I get?**

A: Depends on your package. Standard packages include 2-3 revision rounds. Additional rounds available for a fee. We want you happy, so we're flexible.

---

**Q: What if I need changes after the project is complete?**

A: Minor tweaks within 30 days are usually free. Larger modifications are quoted separately but discounted since we know the project.

---

**Q: Do I need to print with you, or can I take the file elsewhere?**

A: Your choice completely! You own the file. That said, we offer a discount if we print what we design (since we know it'll work perfectly).

---

**Q: Can you match an existing art style?**

A: Usually yes. Provide reference examples and we'll match the aesthetic as closely as possible.

---

**Q: How do you handle confidential or proprietary designs?**

A: We offer NDAs for sensitive projects. Your intellectual property is protected and never shared without written permission.

---

**Q: Can you design something to be sold commercially?**

A: Yes! You own the file and can use it commercially. We can discuss commercial-scale considerations and licensing if you're selling many copies.

---

**Q: What's the most complex thing you've designed?**

A: We've designed everything from intricate jewelry to functional mechanical assemblies with multiple moving parts. If it's physically possible to print, we can design it.

---

**Q: Do you offer 3D scanning services?**

A: Not in-house, but we can recommend partners and work with scan data to create clean, printable models.
