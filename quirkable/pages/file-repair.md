## Section 1: The File Repair Specialists

### Headline
**We Fix What Others Won't Touch**

### Description
Downloaded a file from Thingiverse but it won't slice? Scanned an object but the mesh is a disaster? Exported from CAD and got a jumbled mess?

**You're not alone. And you're in the right place.**

File errors are frustratingly common in 3D printing. Files that look perfect on screen can be riddled with invisible errors that prevent printing. Errors from scanning, bad CAD exports, corrupted downloads, or amateur modeling all create the same problem: your file won't print.

**That's where we come in.**

We specialize in identifying and repairing even the most catastrophic file errors. We've fixed files that have been rejected by every other service. We've repaired scans that looked beyond hope. We've salvaged precious models from corrupted backups.

If there's any way to save your file, we'll find it.

## Section 2: Common File Problems We Fix

### Headline
**From Minor Glitches to Total Disasters**

### Subheadline
Here are the most common issues we encounter (and fix) every single day.

---

### Problem Card 1: Mesh Holes & Gaps

**Icon:** 🕳️

**What It Is:**
Missing faces or edges in the 3D surface create "holes" where the model isn't closed. Printers can't figure out what's inside vs. outside.

**Symptoms:**
- Slicer shows errors
- "Non-watertight" warnings
- Model won't slice properly
- Random missing sections

**How We Fix It:**
We identify all gaps, close them intelligently (preserving design intent), and ensure a fully manifold, watertight mesh.

**Typical Fix Time:** 1-3 hours
**Cost:** £12-30

---

### Problem Card 2: Non-Manifold Geometry

**Icon:** ⚠️

**What It Is:**
Edges or vertices that don't properly define a solid volume. Multiple faces sharing one edge, internal faces, or impossible geometry.

**Symptoms:**
- "Non-manifold edges detected"
- Slicer confusion about inside/outside
- Model appears inside-out in places
- Unprintable despite looking okay

**How We Fix It:**
We analyze topology, separate problem geometry, rebuild connections properly, and ensure every edge is manifold.

**Typical Fix Time:** 2-4 hours
**Cost:** £18-40

---

### Problem Card 3: Inverted Normals

**Icon:** 🔄

**What It Is:**
Surface faces pointing the wrong direction—inside instead of outside or vice versa. Makes printers think solid is empty and empty is solid.

**Symptoms:**
- Model looks weird in slicer
- Wrong areas filled
- Inverted sections
- Bizarre slicing results

**How We Fix It:**
We flip all normals to point outward consistently, ensuring the entire model has correct orientation.

**Typical Fix Time:** 30 minutes - 2 hours
**Cost:** £8-20

---

### Problem Card 4: Thin Walls & Unprintable Features

**Icon:** 📏

**What It Is:**
Sections too thin to print reliably with your chosen material/technology. Often from scaling or poor modeling.

**Symptoms:**
- Slicer warnings about thin features
- Model disappears when sliced
- Walls too thin to extrude
- Details lost

**How We Fix It:**
We identify thin sections, intelligently thicken walls while preserving design, or advise on alternative printing methods.

**Typical Fix Time:** 2-5 hours
**Cost:** £20-50

---

### Problem Card 5: Intersecting Geometry

**Icon:** ⚔️

**What It Is:**
Multiple shapes overlapping or passing through each other, creating conflicting surfaces. Slicer doesn't know which surface to use.

**Symptoms:**
- Strange artifacts in sliced preview
- Random holes or fills
- Slicer confusion
- "Self-intersecting" errors

**How We Fix It:**
We separate intersecting parts, perform Boolean operations properly, and merge geometry cleanly.

**Typical Fix Time:** 2-4 hours
**Cost:** £18-40

---

### Problem Card 6: Bad Scans & Photogrammetry Cleanup

**Icon:** 📸

**What It Is:**
3D scans create noisy, artifact-filled meshes with missing data, noise, and rough surfaces.

**Symptoms:**
- Bumpy, noisy surface
- Missing chunks
- Scan artifacts and camera positions visible
- Unusable for printing

**How We Fix It:**
We smooth noise, fill missing sections, clean up artifacts, reduce poly count intelligently, and create print-ready geometry.

**Typical Fix Time:** 3-8 hours
**Cost:** £30-80

---

### Problem Card 7: Unsupported Overhangs

**Icon:** 🏔️

**What It Is:**
Model design has angles too steep to print without support, or support would be impossible to remove.

**Symptoms:**
- Sagging or failed overhangs
- Impossible to support
- Design won't print as-is

**How We Fix It:**
We redesign problematic angles, add printable geometry, or reorient the model for optimal printing.

**Typical Fix Time:** 2-6 hours
**Cost:** £20-60

---

### Problem Card 8: File Corruption & Format Issues

**Icon:** 💾

**What It Is:**
Corrupted downloads, bad exports, incompatible formats, or damaged file data.

**Symptoms:**
- File won't open
- Import errors
- Partial model loading
- Strange geometry

**How We Fix It:**
We attempt recovery, convert between formats, rebuild from partial data, or work with you to get a better export.

**Typical Fix Time:** 1-4 hours
**Cost:** £12-40

---

## Section 7: File Repair FAQs

### Headline
**Everything You Want to Know About File Repair**

---

**Q: How do I know if my file needs repair?**

A: If your slicer shows errors, won't load the file, or gives warnings about non-manifold geometry, holes, or unprintable sections—you need repair. Upload it for free assessment and we'll tell you exactly what's wrong.

---

**Q: Can you fix any file?**

A: Almost always, yes. In rare cases where a file is so corrupted there's nothing left to work with, we'll tell you honestly and suggest alternatives (like redesigning from scratch).

---

**Q: Will you change my design?**

A: We preserve design intent as much as possible. If changes are needed (like thickening walls), we'll explain why and get your approval first.

---

**Q: Can you simplify my file to reduce size?**

A: Yes! We can optimize polygon count while preserving detail. Great for scan cleanup or reducing file size for faster slicing.

---

**Q: What if the repaired file still doesn't print?**

A: If the issue is due to our repair work, we'll fix it again free of charge. If it's a different issue (printer problems, material issues), we'll help troubleshoot or point you in the right direction.

---

**Q: Do you offer rush repair service?**

A: Yes. Rush service guarantees repair within 24 hours for an additional 50% fee. Subject to availability—contact us first.

---

**Q: Can I get the file repaired AND printed by you?**

A: Absolutely! Many customers do exactly that. We offer a bundled discount: repair + print saves 15% on printing costs.

---

**Q: What if I need multiple versions (low-poly, high-poly, etc.)?**

A: We can create multiple versions during repair. Just let us know your requirements in the initial upload notes.

### Headline
**How to Avoid File Errors in the Future**

### Subheadline
We're here to help, even if that means teaching you to avoid needing us!

---

### For CAD Users:

**✓** Export at reasonable resolution (not too high or too low)
**✓** Use "Save as Mesh" not "Export as Mesh" when possible
**✓** Check for non-manifold geometry before exporting
**✓** Verify units (mm, cm, inches) are correct
**✓** Use STL or 3MF formats for 3D printing

---

### For Downloaded Files:

**✓** Read comments on download sites for known issues
**✓** Check file in mesh viewer before sending to slicer
**✓** Download from reputable sources when possible
**✓** Keep original files as backup before modifications
**✓** Test small/fast prints before large expensive ones

---

### For 3D Scanners:

**✓** Capture more data than you think you need
**✓** Good lighting improves scan quality dramatically
**✓** Use scan cleanup tools immediately after scanning
**✓** Save "raw" scan data before any processing
**✓** Expect to need some repair—scans are never perfect
