## Section 6: File Requirements & Optimization

### Headline
**File Preparation Tips for Perfect Prints**

---

### Accepted Formats

✓ **STL** (Standard Triangle Language) - Most common
✓ **OBJ** (Wavefront Object)
✓ **3MF** (3D Manufacturing Format)
✓ **STEP** (Standard for Exchange of Product Data)
✓ **IGES** (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification)
✓ **Most CAD exports**

**Not sure about your format?** Upload it anyway—we'll let you know if there's an issue.

---

### File Best Practices

#### Wall Thickness
**Minimum recommended:** 1.5mm for FDM, 0.8mm for Resin

**Why it matters:** Thin walls may not print reliably or may be too fragile.

**We'll help:** If your walls are too thin, we'll recommend thickening them or switching materials.

---

#### File Size
**Maximum file size:** 500MB

**Recommended:** Under 100MB for faster processing

**Large files?** Contact us—we can handle massive projects with special upload links.

---

#### Units & Scale
**Always specify:** mm, cm, or inches in your CAD software

**Double-check scale:** A 1mm miniature vs. a 100mm miniature is a big difference!

**We verify:** We'll confirm dimensions before printing.

---

#### Overhangs
**Angles over 45°:** May need support material

**Support marks:** We minimize them, but some may be visible

**Design tip:** Orient overhangs strategically when designing.

---

### Common File Issues (We Can Fix!)

❌ **Holes in mesh** → We repair them
❌ **Non-manifold edges** → We fix geometry
❌ **Inverted normals** → We correct orientation
❌ **Intersecting parts** → We resolve conflicts
❌ **Thin walls** → We advise or thicken

## Section 9: FAQs

### Headline
**Your Questions Answered**

---

**Q: How do I know if my file will print successfully?**

A: Upload it! We provide a free file review within 24 hours. We'll tell you if there are any issues and how to fix them (or we can fix them for you).

---

**Q: What if I don't know which material to choose?**

---

**Q: Can you print in multiple colors?**

A: For single-piece multi-color, we can print using filament changes (manual color switching). For complex multi-color, we recommend printing parts separately or hand-painting.

---

**Q: How accurate are the prints?**

A: FDM: ±0.2mm typically. Resin: ±0.05mm. SLS: ±0.1mm. Actual accuracy depends on geometry, size, and material. We'll advise if your tolerances are critical.

---

**Q: Do you offer rush printing?**

A: Yes! Rush service can cut turnaround by 50% for an additional 30-50% cost. Contact us for availability.

---

**Q: Can you print really large objects?**

A: Our maximum print volume is 30cm × 30cm × 40cm. For larger objects, we can print in sections and provide assembly guidance.

---

**Q: What's the smallest detail you can print?**

A: Resin printing can achieve details as small as 0.1mm. FDM minimum detail is around 0.4mm. We'll advise if your details are too fine.

---

**Q: Can I get a test print first?**

A: For large projects, we can print a small test section or scaled-down version. Contact us to discuss.
