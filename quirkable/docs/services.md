Upload your 3D model file, and we handle the entire printing process from file review to delivery.

### The Process

#### Step 1: Upload
Submit your file through an intuitive online form with drag-and-drop functionality.

#### Step 2: Review
Automated and manual review for printability:
- File integrity check
- Geometry analysis
- Support requirement assessment
- Scaling verification

#### Step 3: Material Consultation
Receive expert recommendations on:
- Best material for your application
- Finish options
- Strength vs. detail trade-offs
- Cost optimization

#### Step 4: Transparent Quotation
Clear pricing breakdown showing:
- Material costs
- Print time
- Post-processing
- Delivery
- No hidden fees

#### Step 5: Production & Delivery
High-quality printing, finishing, quality check, and secure packaging.

### Supported File Formats
- STL (Standard Triangle Language)
- OBJ (Object files)
- 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format)
- STEP (CAD standard)
- Most CAD export formats

### What We Print
- **Custom parts** - Mechanical components, enclosures, mounts
- **Prototypes** - Product development, concept testing
- **Cosplay items** - Armor, props, costume pieces
- **Miniatures** - Gaming, dioramas, scale models
- **Product samples** - Pre-production runs, marketing samples
- **Replacement parts** - Discontinued components, repair pieces
- **Models and proofs** - Architectural, engineering, educational

### Why It Stands Out

## Service 3: 3D File Fixing & Repair

### Overview
**The magical service that turns chaotic meshes into print-ready beauty.**

Many 3D models from online sources, scans, or amateur design contain errors that prevent successful printing. Quirkable's repair service identifies and fixes these issues.

### Common Issues Fixed

#### Mesh Problems
- **Holes in mesh** - Gaps in the 3D surface
- **Non-manifold geometry** - Edges or vertices that don't define a closed volume
- **Inverted normals** - Inside-out surfaces
- **Intersecting geometry** - Overlapping shapes causing conflicts

#### Structural Issues
- **Thin walls** - Sections too delicate to print reliably
- **Unsupported overhangs** - Impossible geometry for printing
- **Sharp angles** - Features that need modification for printability

#### Optimization
- **File optimization for strength** - Reinforcing weak points
- **File optimization for detail** - Preserving fine features
- **Model hollowing** - Reducing material use while maintaining strength
- **Support structure planning** - Minimizing support marks

#### Scan Repair
- **Repairing broken or messy scans** - Cleaning up photogrammetry or 3D scanner output
- **Smoothing artifacts** - Removing scanner noise
- **Closing incomplete scans** - Filling missing data

### Ideal Customer
Anyone who has a 3D model but keeps hearing **"file not printable"** from other services or their own printer.

### Service Tiers

#### Standard Fix (Flat Fee)
- Basic mesh repair
- Wall thickness adjustment
- Simple geometry fixes
- Turnaround: 1-2 business days

#### Complex Repair (Hourly Rate)
- Extensive reconstruction
- Scan cleanup and optimization
- Custom modifications
- Advanced hollowing and support planning
- Turnaround: 3-5 business days

### Deliverables
- Repaired, print-ready file
- Before/after comparison report
- Print recommendations
- File ownership retained by customer
